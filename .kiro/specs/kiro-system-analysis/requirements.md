# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of Kiro's system behavior through systematic examination of /tmp/kiro_full_trace.jsonl and the debug/ folder contents. The analysis will produce detailed reports covering workflow patterns, API interactions, system architecture, prompt templates, context injection mechanisms, and complete API sequence flows to understand how Kiro operates internally and how users interact with the system. The trace file requires specialized parsing to handle binary streaming data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to parse and analyze /tmp/kiro_full_trace.jsonl with proper binary data handling, so that I can extract complete API communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing /tmp/kiro_full_trace.jsonl THEN the system SHALL fix and enhance the parsing script /tmp/parse-streaming-trace.js to handle binary streaming chunks
2. WHEN parsing trace data THEN the system SHALL extract all request/response pairs with complete payload reconstruction
3. WHEN processing streaming chunks THEN the system SHALL properly decode binary data and reconstruct full messages
4. WHEN analyzing parsed data THEN the system SHALL categorize all API endpoints, methods, and authentication patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to analyze debug/ folder contents exclusively, so that I can understand user workflows and system behavior patterns from the available debug data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing debug/ folder THEN the system SHALL extract all execution logs, chat histories, and system events from available files
2. WHEN analyzing debug/chats/*.chat files THEN the system SHALL identify conversation patterns, tool usage, and user interaction flows
3. WHEN examining debug/debug.log THEN the system SHALL categorize system events, error patterns, and performance metrics
4. WHEN processing debug/execution-log.json THEN the system SHALL map execution sequences and system state changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to extract and analyze prompt templates from trace and debug data, so that I can understand how Kiro constructs and uses prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing trace data THEN the system SHALL extract all system prompts, user prompts, and prompt templates
2. WHEN processing chat interactions THEN the system SHALL identify prompt construction patterns and template usage
3. WHEN examining system messages THEN the system SHALL categorize prompt types, contexts, and variations
4. WHEN analyzing prompt data THEN the system SHALL document prompt effectiveness and response patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to extract and analyze context injection mechanisms, so that I can understand how Kiro manages and passes context between interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing trace data THEN the system SHALL identify all context injection points and mechanisms
2. WHEN processing conversations THEN the system SHALL extract context passing patterns and state management
3. WHEN examining system interactions THEN the system SHALL document how context is preserved, modified, and transmitted
4. WHEN analyzing context flow THEN the system SHALL identify context sources, transformations, and usage patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to create complete API sequence flows, so that I can document step-by-step API interactions for specific operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing API traces THEN the system SHALL identify complete operation sequences like "create new hook"
2. WHEN processing API flows THEN the system SHALL document each API call with endpoint, method, request body, and response
3. WHEN examining operation patterns THEN the system SHALL create step-by-step API sequence documentation
4. WHEN documenting API flows THEN the system SHALL include timing, dependencies, and error handling patterns for each sequence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to generate comprehensive analysis reports, so that I can present findings from trace and debug data in an organized format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a workflow analysis report documenting user interaction patterns from debug data
2. WHEN processing is finished THEN the system SHALL create an API sequence report covering complete operation flows
3. WHEN data analysis concludes THEN the system SHALL produce a prompt template analysis report with extracted templates and usage patterns
4. WHEN context analysis is done THEN the system SHALL generate a context injection report documenting context management mechanisms
5. WHEN all analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL create a system architecture report based on observed API patterns and behaviors
