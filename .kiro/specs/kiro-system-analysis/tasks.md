  - Store all data in simple JavaScript objects
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Extract prompt templates and patterns

  - Implement prompt template extractor using string matching
  - Find common prefixes and patterns in system messages
  - Extract template variables using regex patterns
  - Group similar prompts and identify template variations
  - Document all discovered prompt templates with examples
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Analyze context injection mechanisms

  - Implement context analyzer to find context passing patterns
  - Extract context objects from request bodies and conversations
  - Identify file paths, document references, and context sources
  - Track context changes and transformations between interactions
  - Document context injection patterns and mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Create API sequence flows

  - Implement API sequence analyzer to correlate requests and responses
  - Group API calls by conversation ID and operation type
  - Create step-by-step API flow documentation for operations like "create hook"
  - Include request/response bodies, timing, and dependencies
  - Generate complete API sequence documentation with examples
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Generate comprehensive analysis reports
  - Create workflow analysis report from debug data and conversations

  - Generate system architecture report based on observed patterns
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_
- [x] 7. Analyze Kiro's decision-making and inference patterns
  - Analyze how Kiro decides to take next steps after initial user messages
  - Identify triggers that cause multiple LLM inferences during task execution
  - Map the decision tree and branching logic in agent execution flows
  - Document inference patterns, frequency, and decision criteria
  - Create report on agent decision-making mechanisms and inference triggers
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 5.1, 5.3_
- [x] 8. Analyze server-side processing beyond LLM inference
  - Identify all server-side logic and processing that occurs outside of LLM calls
  - Analyze request preprocessing, response postprocessing, and data transformations
  - Document authentication, routing, validation, and business logic components
  - Examine tool execution, file system operations, and system integrations
  - Assess whether replacing the LLM provider would produce identical results
  - Create report on server-side architecture and non-LLM processing components
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 5.2_
- [x] 9. Catalog and analyze Kiro's tool usage
  - Extract all tool calls and tool usage patterns from trace and debug data
  - Identify tool names, parameters, frequencies, and success rates
  - Document tool categories (file operations, system commands, API calls, etc.)
  - Analyze tool usage patterns across different workflow types and contexts
  - Map tool dependencies and common tool usage sequences
  - Create comprehensive tool usage report with examples and statistics
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 3.4, 5.3_
