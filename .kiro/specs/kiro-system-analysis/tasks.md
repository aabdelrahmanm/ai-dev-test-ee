# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up analysis environment and fix trace parser
  - Copy `/tmp/parse-streaming-trace.js` to local analysis directory
  - Fix binary data handling issues in the parser
  - Enhance parser to extract complete API request/response data
  - Test parser with `kiro_full_trace.jsonl` file
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Process debug folder data
  - Create debug data processor to read all files in debug/ folder
  - Parse all `.chat` files and extract conversation data
  - Process `debug.log` and extract system events
  - Parse `execution-log.json` and extract execution data
  - Store all data in simple JavaScript objects
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Extract prompt templates and patterns
  - Implement prompt template extractor using string matching
  - Find common prefixes and patterns in system messages
  - Extract template variables using regex patterns
  - Group similar prompts and identify template variations
  - Document all discovered prompt templates with examples
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Analyze context injection mechanisms
  - Implement context analyzer to find context passing patterns
  - Extract context objects from request bodies and conversations
  - Identify file paths, document references, and context sources
  - Track context changes and transformations between interactions
  - Document context injection patterns and mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Create API sequence flows
  - Implement API sequence analyzer to correlate requests and responses
  - Group API calls by conversation ID and operation type
  - Create step-by-step API flow documentation for operations like "create hook"
  - Include request/response bodies, timing, and dependencies
  - Generate complete API sequence documentation with examples
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Generate comprehensive analysis reports
  - Create workflow analysis report from debug data and conversations
  - Generate API sequence report with complete operation flows
  - Produce prompt template analysis report with extracted templates
  - Create context injection report documenting context mechanisms
  - Generate system architecture report based on observed patterns
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_
