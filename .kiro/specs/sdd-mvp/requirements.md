# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SDD MVP (Software Design Document Minimum Viable Product) is a focused enhancement package for Claude Code CLI that adds Kiro IDE's most valuable missing capabilities. After comprehensive analysis of both Kiro's architecture and Claude Code's extensive feature set, this MVP focuses on the specific gaps: spec-driven development workflows, intelligent hook patterns. Claude Code already provides robust hooks, memory management, MCP integration, SDK capabilities, Docker container support, monitoring, and comprehensive tool orchestration - this MVP builds upon these foundations to create a Kiro-like development experience that can run in containerized environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want spec-driven development workflows integrated with Claude Code's existing capabilities, so that I can systematically plan and implement complex features using structured requirements, design, and task documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request feature planning THEN the system SHALL create structured specs with requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files using Claude Code's and Kiro-derived prompt templates for consistent spec generation
2. WHEN working on specifications THEN the system SHALL provide iterative refinement workflows with user approval at each stage leveraging Claude Code's memory, conversation continuity, and context injection patterns from Kiro analysis
3. WHEN implementing tasks THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide step-by-step guidance using custom slash commands, Claude Code's existing tool orchestration, and task status management templates
4. WHEN completing tasks THEN the system SHALL update task status and suggest next steps using Claude Code's file editing capabilities, project awareness, and context-aware prompt templates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent hook patterns that combine file-based monitoring with Claude Code's built-in hook system for comprehensive proactive development assistance, so that I can get contextual help triggered by both file changes and tool usage events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save code files THEN file-based monitoring hooks SHALL detect changes and trigger Claude Code sessions via SDK to offer suggestions, improvements, and related file updates based on the changed content
2. WHEN Claude Code uses tools (Edit, MultiEdit, Write, Bash) THEN built-in PostToolUse hooks SHALL trigger analysis scripts that can invoke additional Claude Code sessions for validation, formatting, testing, or documentation updates
3. WHEN I modify configuration files THEN file-based monitoring SHALL trigger Claude Code analysis for validation and improvement suggestions, while PreToolUse hooks SHALL validate tool operations on sensitive files
4. WHEN Claude Code finishes responding THEN Stop hooks SHALL evaluate the session and potentially trigger file-based monitoring or additional Claude Code invocations for comprehensive workflow completion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced project templates and setup automation that configure Claude Code with Kiro-like capabilities, so that I can quickly bootstrap projects with intelligent development assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new projects THEN templates SHALL configure Claude Code with pre-built CLAUDE.md memory files containing Kiro-derived system identity, capabilities, and rules templates, hook configurations, MCP server setups, and Docker devcontainer support
2. WHEN setting up existing projects THEN setup scripts SHALL analyze the codebase and configure appropriate Claude Code enhancements including memory with context injection templates, hooks, custom commands, and containerized development environments
3. WHEN onboarding team members THEN setup automation SHALL configure Claude Code with project-specific settings, permissions, workflow patterns derived from Kiro analysis, and provide Docker-based development environments for consistency
4. WHEN maintaining projects THEN management tools SHALL help update and evolve Claude Code configurations as projects grow and change, including container configuration updates and prompt template refinements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom slash commands and MCP integrations that encapsulate sophisticated development patterns, so that I can access advanced workflows through Claude Code's existing command system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use spec-related slash commands THEN they SHALL leverage Claude Code's `.claude/commands/` system, file operations, memory, and Task tool to create, update, and manage specification documents
2. WHEN I use analysis commands THEN they SHALL utilize Claude Code's comprehensive tool set (Read, Grep, Glob, Task, etc.) to perform deep codebase analysis with multi-step sub-agent coordination
3. WHEN I use workflow commands THEN they SHALL orchestrate Claude Code's existing capabilities including TodoWrite for task management and GitHub Actions integration for automation
4. WHEN I use project commands THEN they SHALL adapt behavior using Claude Code's context awareness, project detection capabilities, and custom slash command system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-configured MCP server setups and project templates that leverage Claude Code's existing MCP capabilities, so that I can quickly access development-focused external tools and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up projects THEN templates SHALL include pre-configured `.mcp.json` files with development-focused MCP servers for documentation, APIs, and project management tools
2. WHEN working with specifications THEN project templates SHALL configure MCP servers that integrate with version control systems, issue trackers, and code quality tools using Claude Code's existing MCP infrastructure
3. WHEN implementing features THEN MCP configurations SHALL provide access to deployment tools, testing frameworks, and monitoring systems through Claude Code's standardized MCP support
4. WHEN collaborating THEN project setups SHALL include MCP servers for team communication tools and shared knowledge bases using Claude Code's authentication and permission systems
