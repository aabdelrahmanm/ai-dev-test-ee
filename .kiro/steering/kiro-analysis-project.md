# Kiro System Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This is a one-time analysis project to systematically examine Kiro's system behavior through trace data and debug logs. The goal is to understand how Kiro works internally by analyzing API calls, prompt templates, context injection, and user workflows.

## Key Data Sources

**Primary Data:**
- `kiro_full_trace.jsonl` - Complete network trace with ~9,000 lines of API interactions
- `debug/` folder - Contains debug logs, chat files, and execution data
- `/tmp/parse-streaming-trace.js` - Existing parser that needs fixes

**Data Characteristics:**
- Files are relatively small and manageable
- Binary streaming data in trace file requires special handling
- JSON-based debug files with structured conversation data
- One-time analysis - no need for scalability or ongoing maintenance

## Analysis Goals

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Fix and enhance the existing trace parser to handle binary data properly
2. Extract all prompt templates and system prompts from conversations
3. Document complete API operation sequences (e.g., "create hook" flow)
4. Analyze context injection mechanisms and patterns
5. Generate comprehensive reports covering all system aspects

**Quality Over Speed:**
- Accuracy and completeness are more important than performance
- Focus on extracting maximum insights from available data
- Pragmatic approach - avoid over-engineering for this one-time task

## Implementation Approach

**Pragmatic Strategy:**
- Use simple JavaScript objects for data storage (no complex databases)
- Implement straightforward string matching and regex for pattern detection
- Process all data in memory - files are small enough
- Generate markdown reports with clear examples and findings
- Focus on getting actionable insights quickly

**Error Handling:**
- Skip malformed entries and continue processing
- Log issues but don't fail the entire analysis
- Validate key findings manually
- Include data quality notes in reports
