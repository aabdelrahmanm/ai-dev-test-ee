4. Implement solution with proper testing
5. Create PR with detailed description and link to issue
6. Apply appropriate labels and manage workflow state

### 2. Pull Request Review Workflow (`claude-pr.yml`)
**Purpose**: Provides intelligent PR review, analysis, and automated improvements.

**Triggers**:
- PR events: `opened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review`
- PR labeled with `claude-task`
- Manual workflow dispatch for specific PRs

**Key Features**:
- **Comprehensive code review** with security and quality analysis
- **Automated fix suggestions** and implementation
- **Multi-agent collaboration** for complex changes
- **Integration testing** and validation
- **Review feedback** and iteration support

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Checkout PR branch and analyze changes
2. Run specialized review agents for different aspects
3. Provide detailed feedback and suggestions
4. Implement fixes if requested and safe
5. Update PR with review comments and status
6. Coordinate with issue workflows when applicable

### 3. Setup Validation Workflow (`setup-check.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated setup, configuration validation, and environment preparation.

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch (setup files only)
- Manual workflow dispatch
- First-time repository setup

**Key Features**:
- **Automated environment configuration** for self-hosted runners
- **Comprehensive validation** of secrets, variables, and dependencies
- **Repository label creation** (`claude-task`, `ai-dev`, `claude-working`)
- **System dependency checking** (Docker, inotify-tools)
- **Setup completion tracking** with intelligent re-run detection

**Configuration Tasks**:
1. Configure runner environment variables (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`)
2. Install monitoring tools (`agents-monitor` script)
3. Validate all required secrets and variables
4. Check system dependencies and provide installation guidance
5. Create required repository labels for automation
6. Mark setup as complete to prevent unnecessary re-runs

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent System Architecture

### Agent Manager (MCP-based)
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple specialized agents
- **State Management**: Tracks agent progress and communication
- **Resource Allocation**: Manages computational resources
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error recovery and reporting

### Specialized Agents
- **SWE Agent**: Software engineering tasks, code implementation
- **Test Agent**: Testing, validation, and quality assurance
- **Review Agent**: Code review, security analysis, best practices

### Agent Communication
- **State Files**: JSON-based state tracking in `_tmp/agent_state/`
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time agent status updates
- **Coordination Messages**: Inter-agent communication and handoffs

## üè∑Ô∏è Label System

### Automation Labels
- `claude-task`: Triggers AI automation workflows
- `claude-working`: Indicates active AI processing (prevents conflicts)
- `ai-dev`: General AI development and automation marker

### Workflow Management
- Labels are automatically managed by workflows
- Concurrency control prevents multiple simultaneous runs
- Progress tracking through label states

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment

### Required Secrets
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude AI API access
- `AI_DEV_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with comprehensive permissions

### Required Variables
- `AI_DEV_ENABLED`: Master switch for automation (`true`/`false`)
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`: Claude model identifier
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for Bedrock integration
- `MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level for agent communication

### Optional Configuration
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Custom Bedrock proxy endpoint
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`: Enable Bedrock integration

## üîß System Requirements

### Self-Hosted Runner Environment
- **Docker**: Required for containerized agent execution
- **inotify-tools**: Required for file system monitoring
- **GitHub CLI**: Required for repository operations
- **Git**: Required for version control operations

### Automated Setup
- Environment variables automatically configured in `~/.profile`
- Monitoring scripts installed in `~/.local/bin/agents-monitor`
- PATH automatically updated for tool access
- System validation with dependency checking

## üöÄ Workflow Execution Flow

### Issue Resolution Flow
1. **Issue Created** with `claude-task` label
2. **claude-issue.yml** triggered automatically
3. **Multi-agent analysis** and solution planning
4. **Implementation** with proper testing and validation
5. **PR Creation** with detailed description and issue linking
6. **Review process** can trigger claude-pr.yml if needed

### PR Review Flow
1. **PR Events** trigger claude-pr.yml workflow
2. **Comprehensive analysis** of changes and impact
3. **Multi-agent review** covering different aspects
4. **Feedback provision** with actionable suggestions
5. **Automated fixes** if requested and safe
6. **Integration** with CI/CD and testing workflows

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security Features

### Validation & Checks
- **Comprehensive input validation** before agent execution
- **Security scanning** of code changes and suggestions
- **Permission verification** for all automated actions
- **State consistency** checks and error recovery

### Concurrency Control
