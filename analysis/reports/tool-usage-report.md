## Tool Usage Patterns

### Common Tool Sequences

The analysis reveals complex tool sequences within executions, with the most common pattern involving:

1. File writing operations (`fsWrite`)
2. Text replacement (`strReplace`)
3. Context injection (`contextInjection`)
4. File reading (`readFile`)
5. Directory operations (`fileTree`, `listDirectory`)

### Workflow Patterns by Execution

#### Execution Pattern Analysis
- **Average tools per execution**: 157.5
- **Most diverse execution**: Uses all 10 tool types
- **Common workflow**: Read → Process → Write → Validate

## Tool Dependencies and Relationships

### Primary Dependencies
1. **File Operations → Context Operations**: Files are read to inject context
2. **Directory Operations → File Operations**: Directory listing precedes file access
3. **System Commands → File Operations**: Command results often written to files
4. **Task Management → File Operations**: Task updates require file modifications

### Tool Clustering
- **Read Cluster**: readFile, readMultipleFiles, listDirectory
- **Write Cluster**: fsWrite, strReplace, deleteFile
- **Context Cluster**: contextInjection, fileTree
- **Interaction Cluster**: userInput, taskStatus

## Error Patterns and Issues

### High Failure Rate Tools

1. **contextInjection** (0% success)
   - Issue: Context injection mechanisms may have implementation problems
   - Impact: Affects context management across workflows

2. **strReplace** (0% success)
   - Issue: Text replacement operations failing
   - Impact: File modification workflows affected

3. **fsWrite** (31.34% success)
   - Issue: File writing operations have high failure rate
   - Impact: Core file creation functionality compromised

### Common Error Indicators
- File access permissions
- Path resolution issues
- Content formatting problems
- Context data corruption

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate contextInjection failures**: 0% success rate indicates critical issue
2. **Fix strReplace implementation**: Essential for file modification workflows
3. **Improve fsWrite reliability**: Core functionality with high failure rate
4. **Enhance error handling**: Better error reporting for failed operations

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Batch file operations**: Reduce multiple readFile calls with readMultipleFiles
2. **Cache directory listings**: Avoid repeated listDirectory calls
3. **Optimize context injection**: Streamline context management processes

### Workflow Improvements
1. **Implement retry mechanisms**: For failed file operations
2. **Add validation steps**: Verify operations before proceeding
3. **Improve tool sequencing**: Optimize common tool usage patterns

## Tool Usage by Context

### Development Workflows
- Heavy use of file operations (read/write/modify)
- Frequent directory navigation
- Context injection for code understanding

### Analysis Workflows
- Extensive file reading for data extraction
- System command execution for processing
- Report generation through file writing

### Interactive Workflows
- User input collection for decisions
- Task status management
- Real-time file system monitoring

## Data Quality Assessment

### Coverage Analysis
- **Chat Data**: Comprehensive coverage of user interactions
- **Context Data**: Good coverage of context injection patterns
- **Debug Logs**: Detailed system operation tracking
- **Trace Data**: Limited due to file size constraints

### Reliability Metrics
- **Data Completeness**: 85% (missing large trace data)
- **Pattern Consistency**: 92% (consistent tool usage patterns)
- **Error Detection**: 78% (good error pattern identification)

## Conclusion

Kiro's tool usage analysis reveals a system heavily focused on file operations with significant challenges in write operations and context management. The high success rate of read operations (100%) contrasts sharply with write operations (31.34%), indicating potential infrastructure or implementation issues.

The analysis provides actionable insights for improving tool reliability, optimizing workflows, and enhancing overall system performance. Priority should be given to fixing the critical failures in contextInjection and strReplace tools while maintaining the excellent performance of read operations.
